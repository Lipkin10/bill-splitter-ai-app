# Design AI-First Architecture Task

## Overview

This task guides the systematic design of Claude + Supabase + Redis architecture for AI-first applications, ensuring LGPD compliance and cost optimization.

## Prerequisites

- Project requirements document
- Brazilian market compliance requirements
- User capacity and traffic estimates
- Budget constraints for Claude API usage

## Architecture Design Process

### 1. Requirements Analysis

**Gather and analyze:**
- AI functionality requirements (chatbots, content generation, analysis, etc.)
- Expected user volume and interaction patterns
- Portuguese language processing requirements
- LGPD compliance and data residency needs
- Performance requirements (response times, availability)
- Budget constraints for LLM API costs

### 2. Claude Integration Design

**Design decisions:**
- **Model Selection**: Claude Sonnet vs Haiku based on use case complexity
- **Prompt Architecture**: System prompts, user prompts, conversation management
- **Context Management**: How to maintain conversation state
- **Rate Limiting**: API quota management and user throttling
- **Cost Optimization**: Token reduction strategies, caching patterns
- **Error Handling**: Fallback strategies when Claude is unavailable

**Key patterns:**
- Conversation threading and memory management
- Prompt engineering for Brazilian Portuguese optimization
- Function calling integration for business logic
- Streaming responses for better UX

### 3. Supabase Database Design

**Schema design for AI applications:**
- **Users**: Authentication, profiles, preferences
- **Conversations**: Thread management, message history
- **AI_Sessions**: Context preservation across interactions
- **Knowledge_Base**: RAG content storage and retrieval
- **Usage_Tracking**: Claude API usage monitoring
- **Audit_Logs**: LGPD compliance tracking

**Key considerations:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) for LGPD compliance
- Real-time subscriptions for live chat features
- Edge functions for Brazilian data residency
- Performance optimization for conversation retrieval

### 4. Redis Caching Strategy

**Caching layers:**
- **Session Cache**: Active conversation context
- **Response Cache**: Common AI responses to reduce API calls
- **User Cache**: Frequently accessed user data
- **Rate Limiting**: API quota tracking per user
- **Temporary Storage**: Processing states for long-running AI tasks

**Cache patterns:**
- LRU eviction for conversation context
- TTL strategies for different data types
- Brazilian hosting for compliance

### 5. System Integration Architecture

**Component interaction:**
```
Frontend (Next.js) → API Routes → Redis Cache → Claude API
                                 ↓
                              Supabase DB
```

**Data flow patterns:**
- User input → validation → context retrieval → Claude API → response processing → cache update → response delivery
- Background processes for usage tracking and compliance logging
- Real-time features using Supabase subscriptions

### 6. LGPD Compliance Architecture

**Data protection measures:**
- **Data Minimization**: Only store necessary AI interaction data
- **Consent Management**: User consent tracking for AI processing
- **Data Portability**: Export capabilities for user data
- **Right to Deletion**: Secure data removal processes
- **Processing Logs**: Audit trail for all AI data processing
- **Brazilian Hosting**: Ensure data residency requirements

### 7. Cost Optimization Strategy

**Cost control measures:**
- **Smart Caching**: Reduce redundant Claude API calls
- **Prompt Optimization**: Minimize token usage while maintaining quality
- **Usage Monitoring**: Real-time cost tracking and alerts
- **Tier Management**: Different AI capabilities based on user plans
- **Batch Processing**: Group similar requests for efficiency

### 8. Performance and Scalability

**Architecture patterns:**
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking AI requests
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connections
- **CDN Integration**: Cache static assets and responses
- **Auto-scaling**: Handle traffic spikes efficiently
- **Health Monitoring**: System observability and alerting

## Deliverables
