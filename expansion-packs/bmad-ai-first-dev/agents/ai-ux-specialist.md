  - Example: conversational-ux.md â†’ expansion-packs/bmad-ai-first-dev/tasks/design-conversational-ux.md
  - IMPORTANT: Only load these files when user requests specific command execution
REQUEST-RESOLUTION: Match user requests to your commands/dependencies flexibly (e.g., "design UX"â†’*uxâ†’design-conversational-ux task, "conversation flow" would be dependencies->templates->conversational-flow-design), ALWAYS ask for clarification if no clear match.
