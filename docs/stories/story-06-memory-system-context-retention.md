- Brazilian privacy requirements are met

---

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk:** Memory system violates LGPD requirements
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive legal review and compliance testing
- **Rollback Plan:** Disable memory features until compliance verified

**Secondary Risk:** Memory system doesn't improve user experience
- **Mitigation:** Extensive user testing and feedback
- **Rollback Plan:** Simplify memory features if user experience issues arise

---

## Implementation Notes

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- Use Redis for fast memory access with LGPD compliance
- Implement automatic data retention policies
- Create user consent management system
- Build context-aware algorithms
- Use Brazilian privacy preferences

**LGPD Compliance Requirements:**
- **Data Retention:** Maximum 90 days for conversation data
- **User Consent:** Explicit consent for data retention
- **Right to Deletion:** Immediate deletion upon request
- **Data Portability:** Export functionality for user data
- **Purpose Limitation:** Memory only for improving user experience
- **Transparency:** Clear information about data usage
