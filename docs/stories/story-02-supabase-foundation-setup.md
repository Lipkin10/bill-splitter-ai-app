- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures are tested
- [ ] User management system is functional
- [ ] Security measures are implemented and validated
- [ ] Documentation is complete for the setup
- [ ] Code review is completed and approved
- [ ] Brazilian user testing is completed

---

## Success Gates

**Primary Success Gate:** Users can register and authenticate with full LGPD compliance.

**Secondary Success Gates:**
- Database performance meets Brazilian market requirements
- Security measures protect user data effectively
- Backup and recovery procedures work reliably
- User management system supports Brazilian market needs

---

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk:** LGPD compliance gaps
- **Mitigation:** Legal review and comprehensive compliance testing
- **Rollback Plan:** Disable user registration until compliance verified

**Secondary Risk:** Database performance issues
- **Mitigation:** Performance testing and optimization
- **Rollback Plan:** Scale database resources if needed

---

## Implementation Notes

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- Use Supabase Auth for user management
- Implement Row Level Security for data protection
- Store sensitive data encrypted at rest
- Use Brazilian region for all data storage
- Implement proper data retention policies

**LGPD Compliance Requirements:**
- User consent tracking for all data collection
- Right to data portability (export functionality)
- Right to be forgotten (deletion functionality)
- Data minimization principles
- Purpose limitation for data usage
- Transparency in data processing

---

## Database Schema

**Core Tables:**
```sql
-- Users table with LGPD compliance
users (
  id uuid primary key,
  email text unique,
  phone text,
  cpf_cnpj text,
  consent_given boolean default false,
  consent_date timestamp,
  data_retention_until timestamp,
  created_at timestamp,
  updated_at timestamp
)

-- Conversations table with privacy controls
conversations (
  id uuid primary key,
  user_id uuid references users(id),
  content text,
  processed_at timestamp,
  retention_until timestamp,
  created_at timestamp
)

-- User preferences with consent tracking
user_preferences (
  id uuid primary key,
  user_id uuid references users(id),
  language text default 'pt-BR',
  currency text default 'BRL',
  payment_preferences jsonb,
  consent_settings jsonb,
  created_at timestamp,
  updated_at timestamp
)
```

---

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests for database schema
- [ ] Integration tests for authentication
- [ ] Security tests for data protection
- [ ] LGPD compliance tests
- [ ] Performance tests for Brazilian region
- [ ] Backup and recovery tests
- [ ] User registration flow tests

---

## Documentation Requirements
