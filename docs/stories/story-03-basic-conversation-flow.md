## Story Description

As a user, I want to have a basic conversation with the AI about my expenses in Portuguese so that I can get intelligent bill splitting suggestions through a seamless conversational interface.

This story creates the end-to-end conversation flow that connects the frontend interface with Claude AI and the database, establishing the core user experience for RachaAI.

## Success Gates

**Primary Success Gate:** Users can have natural Portuguese conversations about expenses and receive intelligent splitting suggestions.

**Secondary Success Gates:**
- Conversation flow feels natural and responsive
- Performance meets Brazilian market requirements
- Error handling ensures good user experience
- Mobile experience works well on Brazilian devices

---

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk:** Conversation flow feels unnatural or slow
- **Mitigation:** Extensive testing with Brazilian users and performance optimization
- **Rollback Plan:** Simplify conversation flow if performance issues arise

**Secondary Risk:** Mobile experience doesn't meet Brazilian market needs
- **Mitigation:** Mobile-first design and extensive mobile testing
- **Rollback Plan:** Focus on web experience if mobile issues persist

---

## Implementation Notes

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- Use Next.js API routes for conversation handling
- Implement Redis for session and conversation caching
- Store conversation history in Supabase with LGPD compliance
- Use real-time subscriptions for live updates
- Implement progressive web app features for mobile

**User Experience Considerations:**
- Portuguese-first interface design
- Brazilian cultural context in AI responses
- Mobile-optimized conversation flow
- Clear error messages in Portuguese
- Loading states that feel responsive

---

## Conversation Flow Design

**User Journey:**
1. User opens app and sees Portuguese welcome message
2. User types expense description in Portuguese
3. AI processes and responds with splitting suggestion
4. User can ask follow-up questions or modify the split
5. Conversation continues naturally with context retention
6. Final split is saved and can be shared

**Technical Flow:**
1. Frontend sends Portuguese text to Next.js API
2. API calls Claude AI with conversation context
3. Claude responds with structured expense data
4. Response is cached in Redis for performance
5. Conversation is stored in Supabase
6. Frontend displays response with Brazilian formatting

---

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests for conversation API routes
- [ ] Integration tests for Claude AI integration
- [ ] Performance tests for conversation flow
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness tests
- [ ] Portuguese language accuracy tests
- [ ] Error handling tests
- [ ] Brazilian user experience tests

---

## Documentation Requirements

- [ ] Conversation flow documentation
- [ ] API integration guide
- [ ] Mobile design guidelines
- [ ] Error handling procedures
- [ ] Performance optimization guide
- [ ] Brazilian market testing results

---

## Performance Targets

- **Response Time:** <2 seconds for AI responses
- **Mobile Load Time:** <3 seconds on Brazilian networks
- **Caching Hit Rate:** >80% for repeated queries
- **Error Rate:** <5% for conversation flow
- **Mobile Compatibility:** 95%+ of Brazilian mobile devices
