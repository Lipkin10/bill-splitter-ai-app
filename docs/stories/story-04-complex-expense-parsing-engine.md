## Story Description

As a user, I want the AI to understand complex Portuguese expense descriptions with Brazilian cultural context so that I can describe any expense scenario naturally and get accurate splitting suggestions.

This story implements advanced Portuguese NLP processing that can handle complex Brazilian expense scenarios, cultural contexts, and regional variations with high accuracy.

- Brazilian cultural contexts improve accuracy
- Regional variations are handled correctly
- Complex scenarios are processed accurately
- Fallback mechanisms work for edge cases

---

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk:** Portuguese NLP accuracy below 90% target

- **Rollback Plan:** Fallback to simpler parsing with manual correction options

**Secondary Risk:** Cultural context recognition fails
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive Brazilian cultural training data
- **Rollback Plan:** Disable cultural features if accuracy issues arise

---

## Implementation Notes

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- Use Claude 3.5 Sonnet for complex Portuguese processing
- Implement cultural context training with Brazilian scenarios
- Create regional Portuguese variation support
- Build comprehensive testing with Brazilian users
- Use context-aware splitting algorithms

**Brazilian Cultural Contexts:**
- **Rodízio:** All participants pay equal amounts
- **Happy Hour:** Often split equally or by consumption
- **Churrasco:** Usually split by family/group
- **Vaquinha:** Group contribution scenarios
- **Aniversário:** Birthday party expense splitting
- **Viagem:** Travel expense management

---

## Cultural Pattern Recognition

**Brazilian Expense Patterns:**
- **Equal Split:** "Cada um paga igual"
- **By Consumption:** "Cada um paga o que consumiu"
- **Host Pays:** "Eu pago, depois acertamos"
- **Group Contribution:** "Vamos fazer uma vaquinha"
- **Family Split:** "Divide por família"

**Regional Variations:**
- **São Paulo:** More formal, business-like splitting
- **Rio de Janeiro:** More casual, social splitting
- **Nordeste:** Family-oriented, group-focused splitting
- **Sul:** More individualistic, precise splitting

---

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests for Portuguese NLP processing
- [ ] Integration tests for cultural context recognition
- [ ] Accuracy tests with Brazilian expense scenarios
- [ ] Regional variation tests
- [ ] Cultural pattern recognition tests
- [ ] Fallback mechanism tests
- [ ] Performance tests for complex processing

---

## Documentation Requirements

- [ ] Portuguese NLP processing documentation
- [ ] Cultural context recognition guide
- [ ] Regional variation support documentation
- [ ] Testing framework documentation
- [ ] Accuracy validation procedures
- [ ] Brazilian cultural training data guide

---

## Performance Targets

- **Accuracy:** 90%+ for Portuguese expense interpretation
- **Response Time:** <3 seconds for complex processing
- **Cultural Recognition:** 95%+ accuracy for Brazilian contexts
- **Regional Support:** 85%+ accuracy for regional variations
- **Fallback Success:** 80%+ for unclear descriptions
